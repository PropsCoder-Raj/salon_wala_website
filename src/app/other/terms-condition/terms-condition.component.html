          <h5><strong>Pricing Information:</strong></h5>
          <p>While Lenphor strives to provide accurate product and pricing information, pricing or typographical errors
            may
            occur. Lenphor cannot confirm the price of a product until after you order. In the event that a product is
            listed
            at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to an error in pricing or product information,
            Lenphor
            shall have the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any orders placed for that product, unless
            the
            product has already been dispatched. In the event that an item is mispriced, Lenphor may, at its discretion,
            either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Unless the
            product
            ordered by you has been dispatched, your offer will not be deemed accepted and Lenphor will have the right
            to
            modify the price of the product and contact you for further instructions using the e-mail address provided
            by you
            during the time of registration or cancel the order and notify you of such cancellation. In the event that
            Lenphor
            accepts your order the same shall be debited to your credit card account and duly notified to you by email
            that
            the payment has been processed. The payment may be processed prior to Lenphor dispatch of the product that
            you
            have ordered. If we have to cancel the order after we have processed the payment, the said amount will be
            reversed
            back to your credit card account.</p>
          <p>We strive to provide you with the best prices. However, sometimes a price online does not match the price
            in a
            store. In our effort to be the lowest price provider in your particular geographic region, store pricing may
            sometimes differ from online prices. Prices and availability are subject to change without notice.</p>

          <p>Please note that there may be certain orders that we are unable to accept and must cancel. We reserve the
            right,
            at our sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. Some situations that may result in
            your
            order being canceled include limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies or errors in
            product
            or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. We may also
            require
            additional verifications or information before accepting any order. We will contact you if all or any
            portion of
            your order is canceled or if additional information is required to accept your order. If your order is
            canceled
            after your credit card has been charged, the said amount will be reversed back in your Card Account.</p>
